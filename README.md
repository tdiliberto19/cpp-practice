# Practice C++ Programming
  This repository is a personal playground for practice programming in C++. It consists of many individual files consisting of single
  or few functions generally to accomplish one problem. It will not contain any code from larger projects or coursework.
  
  Note: The a.out file can generally be ignored; it is only the compiled file for the current branch.
